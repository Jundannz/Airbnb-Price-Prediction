Reizen is mijn passie, waardoor ik al veel van de wereld heb gezien. 

Mijn te huur aangeboden moderne, luxe villa’s heb ik persoonlijk bezocht en geïnspecteerd, zodat ze voldoen aan de Japanse standaard. Dit betekent een hoge standaard van netheid en gastvrijheid. 

Via onderstaande link kun je mijn luxe Airbnb verhuur villa’s o.a. in Bali, Chiang Mai, Phuket, Koh Samui, Hua Hin en Singapore bekijken. 

https://www.airbnb.com/users/800558/listings

De meeste villa’s die ik verhuur kennen een extra service tegen vergoeding, denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan: autoverhuur met chauffeur, spa en massage service, privé chef kok en/of kinderopvang. 

Ik help je graag je een onvergetelijke vakantie te ervaren.

We have been on countless journeys across the world! One of the most memorable one was the Trans-Siberia train ride from Beijing to Moscow. We learnt a lot about each other during that trip and well, the rest is history.  Since then, we try to go to new places every opportunity we get. There's always one memorable story from each of our travels (walked from Tromsø airport to our B&B during winter...) and we hope to be part of yours! We will be more than happy to share our limited experience traveling around the world.

Both of us are gym addicts and ardent football fans (Kathir plays weekly for a team). If we're not watching EPL on weekends we would probably be playing FIFA. We love music as well and have been to a number concerts together. Mostly stuff from the 80s and 90s.

We are also proud pawrents of 3 cavaliers; Troy, Maya, and Cassie.

 Let me introduce myself to all of you.  I am Avid Traveler, visited many countries for business as well as leisure. Very much interested in culture, tradition, food of places I visit, ever used Airbnb as a guest, likes the concept and feels like there is nothing like to host the other people and share ideas and experiences to those who are visiting my country. I have passion to host,
So I decided to be a host in my own home country, Singapore.
As I strongly feel there is certain chemistry between Host & Guest and one doesn't need to be an Alchemist to understand that all it needs is the passion to host . So welcome to Singapore & be my guest...
PS: My expertise is in short term stays also for additional information about same please visit    website   mresidence .com

33634552,"Hi everyone ,
 Let me introduce myself to all of you.  I am Avid Traveler, visited many countries for business as well as leisure. Very much interested in culture, tradition, food of places I visit, ever used Airbnb as a guest, likes the concept and feels like there is nothing like to host the other people and share ideas and experiences to those who are visiting my country. I have passion to host,
So I decided to be a host in my own home country, Singapore.
As I strongly feel there is certain chemistry between Host & Guest and one doesn't need to be an Alchemist to understand that all it needs is the passion to host . So welcome to Singapore & be my guest...

3382337,"Hi, I'm Augustus and I work in social media :-)

A bit too everything for my own good. I've made a lifestyle out of having one too many balls up in the air - not the warm kind. No concussions so far, at least that I can remember. 

NOTE: I guess it was bound to happen at some point: ended up meeting a disgruntled host in NY last year that put me in a scary situation. Long story short: Airbnb awarded in my favour and put me up in a nice hotel on their dime - managed to dig up a record of public complaints with the local government that the tenants had filed due to poor maintenance. Thank goodness for public records, and I hope that will be the last time I need to do a search!

Addicted to books - I churn through them like a coke fiend in Vegas. The authors would be none too happy. 

Documentaries over war films. Comedies over rom-com's. 

Also, I like Ikea. That's pretty random, but I'm an inveterate hacker/designer so Ikea's a sort of graveyard of parts for new projects.

Interests:
Guilty pleasures - Obscure/esoteric documentaries, reality TV (people are stranger than fiction), techno-babble (philosophy)

Architecture/design - I could stare at architecture all day. Even bad architecture holds some perverse thrill.

Board games - Settlers of Cataan (my new fave), Monopoly (studied the minutae of this game)

New media - Blinking lights, videos, gamification, computer-mediated communication, digitized food, social food, social networks

Art, culture, tech, startups, fashion, writing, dance, yoga

Philosophy:
In work, I've taken the road less travelled. I'm lucky enough to have the opportunity to tackle problems without precedents.

In life, I travel for people and architecture. Design comes in a close third.

I've made a profession of describing the visual in plain English for over 6 years, but watching the sun rise behind Angkor Wat is as close as I've gotten to speechlessness.

I hold the belief that I can get along with anyone if I'm willing to see things from their side.

Music, Movies, Books:
Tough - very tough

Books - Travel literature (I mean Biddlecombe and Potts, not Lonely Planet!), PJ O'Rourke (the early stuff), David Sedaris (I have a soft spot for a good wit)

Films - Indie romantic comedies, ensemble casts, foreign films, pseudo-philosophical horror, pseudo-philosophical sci-fi, documentaries about anything",,,,Serangoon,1,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,,Serangoon,North-East Region

Now I’m a researcher and consultant for public problems.  

I’ve been quite lucky to meet some beautiful minds — explorers and travellers as we are. I love meeting new people, everyone tells their own stories.

Reizen is mijn passie, waardoor ik al veel van de wereld heb gezien. 

Mijn te huur aangeboden moderne, luxe villa’s heb ik persoonlijk bezocht en geïnspecteerd, zodat ze voldoen aan de Japanse standaard. Dit betekent een hoge standaard van netheid en gastvrijheid. 

Via onderstaande link kun je mijn luxe Airbnb verhuur villa’s o.a. in Bali, Chiang Mai, Phuket, Koh Samui, Hua Hin en Singapore bekijken. 

https://www.airbnb.com/users/800558/listings

De meeste villa’s die ik verhuur kennen een extra service tegen vergoeding, denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan: autoverhuur met chauffeur, spa en massage service, privé chef kok en/of kinderopvang. 

Ik help je graag je een onvergetelijke vakantie te ervaren.

Heb je een persoonlijke wens en/of vraag? Mail me en ik help je graag!

Read my reviews and when you get here, ask for the guest book, you will get to know heaps of great friends across the globe! 

Also - Finally being an Airbnb host since 2011, we obtained our Hotel License to legally operate in Singapore for short term stays!

As Singapore is a Food Paradise, I love to eat and will not hesitate to introduce good food to you. I have a few friends working as Uber or Grab drivers, they would be glad to offer you a special rate should you book with us.

Our properties are generally a simple renovated walkup apartment without any amenities like pools or gym, however the area is clean and affordable, as our properties are generally walkup apartments thus we do not recommend travelers with very young kids or infants. 

As Singapore is a Food Paradise, I love to eat and will not hesitate to introduce good food to you. I have a few friends working as Uber or Grab drivers, they would be glad to offer you a special rate should you book with us.

Thank you and look forward receiving you as our guest soon.

I really enjoy meeting new people, and I'd love to recommend you places/food/activities, or bring you around Singapore if you want. (Can only do that when I’m in SG.) 

Also, my parents live near the apartment. They can go over in the event where you may require any help! 

I enjoy reading, skateboarding, watching movies, and going out.

Our properties are generally a simple renovated walkup apartment without any amenities like pools or gym, however the area is clean and affordable, as our properties are generally walkup apartments thus we do not recommend travelers with very young kids or infants. 

As Singapore is a Food Paradise, I love to eat and will not hesitate to introduce good food to you. I have a few friends working as Uber or Grab drivers, they would be glad to offer you a special rate should you book with us.

Thank you and look forward receiving you as our guest soon.

42124141,"A gleaming metropolis known to be a melting pot of cultures, Singapore makes for a unique travel destination. Skyscrapers live harmoniously among heritage buildings that date as far back as the early 1900s, whose architectural styles tell tales of the city’s colonial past.

Known as ‘The Garden City’ for its constant stream of manicured tree-lined streets and bushes dotted with bright flowers, Singapore is an unexpected wonderland for fans of all things green. It is in this beautiful landscape of concrete and nature that the Somerset Bencoolen Singapore is located.

A variety of museums and temples sit just a short 5- to 10-minute walk away from the Somerset residence. Visit Little India where colourful temples and a smorgasbord of spicy, sweet culinary treats can be found, and later, the National Gallery or Singapore Art Museum, where travellers and locals alike walk among Southeast Asian artwork.

Within a 10-minute drive away is Mustafa Shopping Centre, a 24-hour shopping mall located at the edge of Little India that is dedicated to stocking everything from spices to gold, electronic products to basketball shoes. Another shopping haven of quite a different scale is Orchard Road, where a slew of shopping malls decked with high street and designed labels are rolled out, which is just two train stops away from the close-by Dhoby Ghaut train station.

For food, guests will be spoilt for choice at the range of culinary offerings available in the vicinity, from incredible brunch fare to quaint cafés dotting the area. But worth travelling for is the nationwide favourite chilli crab, which is steamed crabs tossed in a sticky, sweet, mildly spicy sauce found mostly in the East, along with Lagoon Food Village, where a diverse range of food stalls reside. Here, visitors can find a heady mix of flavours and dishes inspired by Chinese, Malay and Indian cuisines.

After a long day of exploring, retire to Somerset Bencoolen Singapore to refresh yourself. Guests can choose from a range of apartment types, from 1-bedroom to 2-bedroom apartments.

Guests are also given full access to a comprehensive list of amenities available in-house such as the fully equipped gymnasium, outdoor swimming pool and children's wading pool, an outdoor garden, residents' lounge and a business centre services.",,,,Rochor,2,"['email', 'phone']",t,,Rochor,Central Region

I love walking and discovering new neighbourhoods and cosy places, cooking, making things, and making things better. I also love playing and learning new tech, reading, and watching sci-fi. Solaris, Rick and Morty, Ursula K Le Guin. 

I co-founded a school that teaches kids how to create with technology and design. Then I co-founded a fabrication cafe at the ArtScience Museum in Singapore, an online art gallery x interdisciplinary art - tech publication, a database for architects to choose sustainable materials. Now I’m a researcher and consultant for public problems.  

I’ve been quite lucky to meet some beautiful minds — explorers and travellers as we are. I love meeting new people, everyone tells their own stories. 

When I travel I like to see some nature, art, quaint corners and neighbourhoods. That last bit describes my home, a calm apartment nestled in a heritage neighbourhood, east of Singapore.

1333775744789750642,"K2 Guesthouse is designed for guests who want a truly local experience with local people. Experience eating local food in a local home away from home! 

We love meeting new people, exchanging cultures, food, language and most of all spending some time in the evening after work to relax with a glass of wine or a can of beer when the weather becomes unbearable!

Read my reviews and when you get here, ask for the guest book, you will get to know heaps of great friends across the globe! 

Also - Finally being an Airbnb host since 2011, we obtained our Hotel License to legally operate in Singapore for short term stays!

We would like to take this opportunity to appreciate all our faithful long term guests who have stayed and support us during all these years.  Please come back to experience our the new K2 Guesthouse at South Buona Vista. 

We'd love to have you with us :)
